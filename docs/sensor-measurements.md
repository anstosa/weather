# Sensor measurement inventory

The normalized weather point supports every unique environmental measurement in
the purchased Ecowitt sensor set. A measurement has one canonical field even
when several devices report it; the source record identifies the originating
gateway or sensor.

## Canonical point measurements

| API field | Database column | Canonical unit | Supplied by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `temperatureC` | `temperature_c` | °C | GW3000, WS90, WH52, WN30, WN31 |
| `apparentTemperatureC` | `apparent_temperature_c` | °C | Open-Meteo |
| `blackGlobeTemperatureC` | `black_globe_temperature_c` | °C | WN38 |
| `wetBulbGlobeTemperatureC` | `wet_bulb_globe_temperature_c` | °C | WN38 with a compatible outdoor temperature/humidity source |
| `relativeHumidityPercent` | `relative_humidity_percent` | % | GW3000, WS90, WN31 |
| `pressureHpa` | `pressure_hpa` | hPa | GW3000, Open-Meteo |
| `precipitationMm` | `precipitation_mm` | mm per observation interval | WH40H, WS90, Open-Meteo |
| `precipitationRateMmPerHour` | `precipitation_rate_mm_per_hour` | mm/h | WH40H, WS90 |
| `windSpeedMps` | `wind_speed_mps` | m/s | WS90, Open-Meteo |
| `windGustMps` | `wind_gust_mps` | m/s | WS90, Open-Meteo |
| `windDirectionDegrees` | `wind_direction_degrees` | degrees | WS90, Open-Meteo |
| `solarRadiationWm2` | `solar_radiation_wm2` | W/m² | WS90 |
| `uvIndex` | `uv_index` | UV index | WS90 |
| `pm25MicrogramsPerCubicMeter` | `pm25_micrograms_per_cubic_meter` | µg/m³ | WH41 |
| `soilMoisturePercent` | `soil_moisture_percent` | % | WH52 |
| `soilElectricalConductivityMicrosiemensPerCm` | `soil_electrical_conductivity_us_cm` | µS/cm | WH52 |
| `cloudCoverPercent` | `cloud_cover_percent` | % | Open-Meteo |

## Deduplication boundary

- Temperature and humidity are not duplicated by device model or channel.
- WH40H and WS90 rainfall use the same precipitation fields.
- Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, event, and lifetime rainfall totals are
  derived from normalized interval amounts rather than stored as separate point
  measurements.
- AQI and 24-hour PM2.5 averages are derived from the normalized PM2.5 series.
- Relative pressure is derived from the canonical measured pressure and site
  elevation rather than stored as a second pressure measurement.
- Battery condition and radio health are device telemetry, not weather point
  measurements, and belong in a separate telemetry record.
